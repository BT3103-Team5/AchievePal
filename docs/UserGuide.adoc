The courseProfile contains four components, which is Number of submitted assignments vs Time usage scatter chart, course's details, registered student list as well as released assignment list. 

image::CourseScatter.png[align="center"]

The Number of submitted assignments vs Time usage charts plots how many assignments has each student submitted (X-axis) versus 
the average time used by that student to finish one assignment (Y-axis). Apparently those who are located at the top spend the most time on the assignments, which means they may spend a hard time solving the given problem, and those who are located at the left side may have dedicated less time to assignments compared to other students. 
[TIP]
Figures about each student will appear when user hovers around the dots. 

image::CourseList.png[align="center"]
Student List contains all the student names as well as number of assignments finished by each of them. To the right of it, assignment list contains all the assignment together with the submission rate for each of them.

[NOTE]
The time used to finish each assignment is calculated by the difference of time between when the assignment is released and when the student submits the solution.

==== Use chat box to discuss with other students within the same class.
